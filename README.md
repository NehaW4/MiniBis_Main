**#Miibiz App**

MiniBiz is an Android app designed for online shopping. It's like having a virtual store in your pocket. Here's how it works:

1. **Empowering Customers**: This means that the app gives power to the people who want to buy things. Customers can do a lot of things with the app:
   - They can put items they want to buy into a virtual cart, just like a real shopping cart in a store.
   - They can create and manage their own profiles, which is like having their own space in the app.
   - They can place orders for the things they want to buy.
   - They can keep an eye on the delivery status of their orders, so they know when to expect their items.

2. **Seller Command Center**: This part of the app is for people who want to sell things online. Sellers can:
   - Add the products they want to sell to the app, just like putting items on the shelves in a store.
   - Keep track of all the transactions happening, like seeing who's buying what.
   - Have control over the orders they receive, meaning they can decide whether to accept or reject orders from customers.
   - Manage their own profiles within the app.

3. **Firebase Precision**: Firebase is like the brain behind the scenes of the app. It stores all the data about the products and users securely. Here's how it works:
   - Every product in the app has its own unique ID, so it's easy to keep track of them.
   - There's a system in place to make sure that only the right people can access the app. This keeps everything safe and secure for both customers and sellers.
